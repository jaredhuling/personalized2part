Description: Implements the methodology of Huling, Smith, and 
    Chen (2020) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2020.1801449>, which allows for subgroup identification 
    for semi-continuous outcomes by estimating individualized treatment rules. It uses a two-part 
    modeling framework to handle semi-continuous data by separately modeling the positive part 
    of the outcome and an indicator of whether each outcome is positive, but still results in a 
    single treatment rule. High dimensional data is handled with a cooperative lasso penalty, 
    which encourages the coefficients in the two models to have the same sign.
